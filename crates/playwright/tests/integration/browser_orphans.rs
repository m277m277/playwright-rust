//! The driver owns the browser processes. If we kill the driver without
//! letting it tear them down, headed Chrome survives and is reparented to
//! init — a leak the client can never clean up afterwards.
//!
//! Headless Chromium exits on its own when its parent dies, so only a headed
//! launch exercises this. That means the test needs a display: it skips on a
//! Linux box without one rather than reporting a false pass.
