#
# Surfaces the flaky tests a green CI job hides.
#
# `profile.ci` sets `retries = 1`, so a test that fails once and passes on
# the retry exits 0. The job goes green and the only trace is one FLAKY
# line in the middle of a few thousand lines of log, which nobody reads.
# That is why the flaky-test tracker only ever recorded tests that failed
# *both* attempts, and why "the tracker is empty" could not be told apart
# from "nothing was looking".
#
# Reads the nextest logs captured by the test steps, writes the flaky test
# names to the job summary and as warning annotations, and exits 0: a
# flake is something to record and watch, not something to fail a build
# over.
#
# It distinguishes three things, because conflating them either cries wolf
# on every broken build or goes quiet exactly when it matters:
#
#   * A log that never reached a summary. The step failed to compile, or
#     was killed by its timeout. Warns and moves on, per log, so a stress
#     lane that died is visible rather than absorbed by its healthy
#     sibling, but an ordinary build break does not also paint this step
#     red.
#   * A log whose summary disagrees with its FLAKY lines, or a FLAKY line
#     this script cannot parse. That is nextest's output format moving
#     under us, and it exits non-zero, because the alternative is silence
#     that reads like good news.
#   * Everything else: report and exit 0.
#
# Usage: scripts/report-flaky-tests.sh <nextest-log> [<nextest-log>...]
